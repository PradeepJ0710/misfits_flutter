**Misfits** (“the App”) is developed and maintained by **Pradeep Jothibaskar** (“I”, “me”, or “the developer”). This Privacy Policy explains how I collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use the App.

By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

This data will be used only to provide and enhance core App features.

- Send push notifications (via Firebase Cloud Messaging)
- Improve app functionality, stability, and user experience (future analytics & crash reporting)

### 3. Permissions Used
The App may request the following permission:

- Notifications Permission – requested only when needed in order to send reminders, updates, or other relevant notifications.

No other sensitive permissions are used currently. Future updates may request additional permissions only when required to support new features.

### 4. How Your Information Is Stored
Your data is stored using secure, industry-standard cloud services provided by Google Firebase, including:

- Firebase Authentication

I do not store your data on external servers outside Firebase.

No data is sold, rented, or shared for marketing purposes.

### 6. Data Retention & Deletion
Your data is retained as long as your account exists in the App.

If you wish to delete your account/data:

- You may submit a Data Deletion Request Form, available through the Google Play Store listing of the App.

Upon receiving a valid request, I will delete your account and associated data from Firebase within a reasonable time.

### 7. Security
I use Firebase’s built-in security features and industry-standard practices to protect your data. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.

You agree to use the App at your own discretion and understand that absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

The App is intended only for users who are 18 years and older. I do not knowingly collect data from anyone under the age of 18.
If you believe a minor has used the App, please contact me at pradeep071097@gmail.com.

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time as the App grows and new features are introduced.
When changes are made:

Continued use of the App after updates means you accept the revised policy.
